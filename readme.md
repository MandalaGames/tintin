__What is Tintin?__

Tintin is a Python application you can use to take Geotiff files, a common elevation file format, and turn them into an array of triangles suitable for a game engine like Unity.

__How does it work?__

Tintin currently has two parts: an "environment simulator" and an elevation data generator. 
The environment simulator generates sprites on an environment and simulates the CO2 generated by houses and factories, on the one hand, and absorbed by trees, on the other. It does not currently use the real elevation data, but in the future it will.

To use this part of the application, install the dependencies first:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run:

```bash
python pygameInterface.py
```

You should see a window pop up with a background and some sprites.

__Elevation data generator__

The second part is the elevation data generator. The readme for that section is in-progress.

__Where can I get Geotiff files?__

For the United States, you can find them at the [US Geographical Survey](https://viewer.nationalmap.gov)
